# Terraforming

This repository contains Terraform configurations for two major cloud providers: AWS and Azure.

## aws/
The `aws` folder contains Terraform projects for deploying and managing infrastructure on Amazon Web Services. Each subfolder (such as `test1` and `test2`) represents a separate environment or project configuration.

## azure/
The `azure` folder contains Terraform projects for deploying and managing infrastructure on Microsoft Azure. Each subfolder (such as `test1`, `test2`, and `zajecia1`) represents a separate environment or project configuration.
